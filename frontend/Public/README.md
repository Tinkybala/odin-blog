#Blog Website

In the project, I have a RESTful API created with node that connects to a mongoDB database. There are 2 seperate frontends: One for readers, and one content management system website, both of which uses the API to modify the database.

Things that are still in progress:
1. More interactive frontend (changing colors of input borders etc)
2. Nicer website design
3. Image uploads onto some file storage service
